# Trello Remade

My take on making a trello like clone, that feature Drag and Drop for tasks. Still in production, so keep an eye out to see how it looks.

If you wanna have a peek at what's inside, here is the [Link](https://customtrello.firebaseapp.com/)

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the project into your desired folder by typing

```
git clone https://github.com/ahmedu007/Trello-Remade
```

2. Make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine

   ```
   node -v
   ```

   you will need version 8.x or above to run this properly.

3. Install all dependencies:
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```
4. To serve the code, run
   ```
   $ npm start
   ```
   this will navigate to your localhost:3000 on your defaul browser.
5. Run the tests;
   ```
   $ npm test
   ```
